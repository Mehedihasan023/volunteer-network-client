Welcome to the Volunteer Network! This website allows users to choose events to volunteer for. It employs Firebase for authentication and registration methods, as well as Express.js with MongoDB for the server-side. Users can view their registered events, delete registrations, and event organizers can add, delete, update or manage events.
